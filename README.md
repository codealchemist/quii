# quii

Cute johnny-five quadbot controlled by a nunchuk.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/codealchemist/quii
cd quii
npm install
```

## Start

`npm start`

## How it works?

Commands from the nunchuk are sent to the quadbot to control
its movement.

## What's needed?

A quadbot and a nunchuk connected to their own Arduino boards.
Both with firmata installed.
You will also need to customize your board ports.

Once you have that working this is super fun!
:D
